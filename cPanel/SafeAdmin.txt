3SCENARIO:

These are the only additional IP addresses showing, though. They report that they should be showing 22 additional IP addresses. Of the following choices, which would 

have a higher likelihood of being the source of the issue here?


The discrepancy in the broadcast address between cp1 and the remaining secondary interfaces indicates that there is likely to be a routing issue that is causing the 

interface configuration to break.
The maximum number of IP addresses assigned to this server is incorrect for the subnet given to them, which is indicated by the "Numerical result out of range" error 

in reference to the subnet mask calculation.
The maximum number of characters in the interface names was exceeded after the 9th secondary interface because of the additional digit was introduced in the interface 

name.- answer
The maximum number of IP addresses that can be bound per interface is 10, meaning that the primary IP address in addition to the 9 secondary IP addresses have caused 

this interface to reach its maximum.

Your customer has attempted to set up quotas in their cPanel & WHM environment, however they are still reporting that quotas are not functioning as expected.

Your customer's default system PHP configuration specifies for PHP to use the America/Caracas time zone. However, they report that, when accessing 

http://domain.tld/testing.php, it seems to be utilizing the Europe/Moscow time zone instead. From the following statements, which most likely explains what is 

occurring here?

The currently selected PHP handler is altering the active time zone at runtime.
There is likely to be system clock skew on the server, causing errors in time zone calculation.
Europe/Moscow has been specified as the time zone within a custom, user-level PHP configuration file. - answer
The script and/or account has likely been compromised by someone from the Europe/Moscow time zone.
None of these are likely.

Your customer reports that they cannot ping any domains on their server by name, but that they are able to ping the IP addresses associated with the domains, as 

well as the nameservers. Online DNS testing tools also report the domains as being offline. 

Querying the domains locally from within the server works. You perform a  tcpdump, showing that remote queries are reaching the server, but that it is simply not 

responding to them. There are no firewall rules preventing the queries from getting through. Your customer reports that switching to NSD or other nameserver software 

resolves their issue, but that they need to use bind. The named service appears to be up and running properly.

Given the following choices, which describes the issue that has the highest likelihood of being at fault here?




The Apache configuration may be missing VirtualHost entries for the domains on the server. The customer may have attempted to manually modify the httpd.conf, resulting 

in the problem. - answer
The queries are reaching the server, but are not being handled properly by bind specifically. There may be a problem with the configuration in the named.conf file.
None of these are applicable. You should determine what the customer needs with bind specifically, and assist the customer in configuring one of the alternate 

nameserver software choices to fit their needs.
The information stored for each of the domains' nameservers at the registrar may be incorrect, which is affecting the destination of queries for the customer's 

domains.

These are continuing to appear even as you continue to tail -f the log file.

Given the following choices, which of these would be the most appropriate next step to take in diagnosing this issue?


Set the immutable attribute on the cpuser2's cron file (chattr +i /var/spool/cron/cpuser2), then run the cPanel update script (/scripts/upcp).
Compare the user's currently running process count (ps -U cpuser2 | wc -l) with the system's user limits for the user (su - cpuser2 -c "ulimit -u") - answer
Run netstat with extended information to provide user ID and inode with the connection list (netstat -natpe), compare against cpuser2's user ID (id -u cpuser2), and 

look for excessive connections using cpuser2-owned processes.
Check the current system load average (cat /proc/loadavg, top, w, or uptime) and compare with the iowait that exists on the system (iostat).

Updates on the client system are failing. As part of the troubleshooting process, you perform an strace of the upcp script. The following entry is seen repeatedly 

throughout the strace output: 


capget({_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, 0}, NULL) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
In addition to this, you also identify the following within the dmesg log:

[4083794.715698] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda]  Add. Sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
[4083794.715702] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] CDB: Read(10): 28 00 e6 90 00 00 00 00 08 00
[4083794.715710] end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 3868196864
[4083794.718683] ata1: EH complete


Which of the following options best describes the most likely situation demonstrated by the above information?

Excessive iowait
Kernel out of date.
Imminent CPU failure.
High load on server
Physical drive issues.- answer
No virtual memory available.
